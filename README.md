 Sentimental-Analysis-on-Twitter-Data

The purpose of the project is to mine the sentiments of tweets. In this project we have used data scrapped from twitter using tweepy API.

**#About the Dataset**

Our dataset contains 50k data points. We found that there is class imbalance in our data. So we tried different statistical methods like oversampling, undersampling and
SMOTE method to balance the class distribution.
For this project we have used Bag of words for feature extraction and for modelling we used LSTM model. Finally we have deployed this model in streamlit
